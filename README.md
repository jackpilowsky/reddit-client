## A small note on styling

This project uses Material-UI's withStyles HOC for dealing with styles. I like using withStyles because:

1. It doesn't require any setup. 
2. Complies with React's component-based system. No stylesheets expanding multiple components.
3. Doesn't incurr the performance penalty that inline-styles do. 

I could have used CSS or SASS or inline-styles. But I chose this one.
